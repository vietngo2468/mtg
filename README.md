Objective:

    Gather general goods, weapons, armor, magical (wondrous) items, spells (for scrolls, wands, and staffs), potions, etc., into an offline document—format can be JSON, CSV, NoSQL, or TXT.
• Each item should include: Name, Price, and Description.
• Include SRD varieties such as different metal types and enchantments. This distinction is important because while the Player’s Handbook provides price modifiers, it does not list each variety explicitly.
• Rarity and other classifications can be figured out later (similar to Donjon).
• Ensure they are separated by their distinction, so blacksmith, magic shop, apothecary, general good store for easier parsing.

    Gather all monsters into a similar document with the following details:
• Required: Monster Name, Challenge Rating (CR), Type, Size, and possibly a Description.
• No additional work is expected beyond collecting this data. Later, we can figure out pricing and unique purchasable items in different shops (e.g., Butcher, Tailor, Restaurants). I'll work with you on this when the time comes.


An additional thing you might be able to find easy from that site is curses. We can randomly curse weapons. I know there are specific weapons in SRD that have specific curses, but there is also general curses we can randomly add when we generate a shop.
Futher goal Butcher Shop plan as i said earlier, we can also do jeweler shop, we can create random meals for restaurants. But this is all style and flare, no need to focus on it
